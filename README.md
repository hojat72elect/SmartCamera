This is a multiplatform React Native camera app.
Up until now, I have implemented these features in this app:
<ol>
<li>The ability to change between <b>front</b> and <b>back</b> camera.</li>
<li>Flash mode.</li>
<li>Capture button.</li>
<li>The mechanism of asking for camera permissions.</li>
</ol>

**This is an Expo-managed app**
